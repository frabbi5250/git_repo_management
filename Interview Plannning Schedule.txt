Sunday:

What I want to accomplish:
	-Finish at least two lectures of my master's class
	-Finish prepping for my interview
	-Finish the App Academy Assessments
	-Workout at the gym and focus on the commitment plans I had
	-Practice my Deen a lot more seriously

Why I have the following desires:
	- The main intention that I have always had, to please Him
		(How is that going?)
	-So that I am able to make decisions to accomplish my goals for His sake.
		(How is that going?
	-So that I do not fall behind, procrastinate, panic, and develop anxiety and distress and start ruining my other days  all because of the fact that I did not plan well.
		(How is that going?)
	-So that I may focus on what I really really REALLY want to do!!!
		(How is that going?
	-So that I may develop right emotions, use the right amount of energy, as well as the right amount of time spent well because these questions will be the targets of my ending in the Hereafter.
		(How is that going?)


What can I do to achieve all this?
	-Remove all distractions. If using laptop, no using YouTube unless for purposes that are important.
	-Turn off the phone or set it to vibrations.
